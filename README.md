# Ruby on Rails simple 'hello-world' app

This is my first application developed using Ruby on Rails
I have followed the instructions from ['Ruby on Rails Tutorial'](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning) ebook.
This book is written by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/)

The hello world app is deployed ['here'](https://lit-bastion-27507.herokuapp.com/)
